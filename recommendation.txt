This study uses 1562 data points between the 8th of March 2020 and the 16th of June 2024
to predict the number of new covid-19 cases for the 7 days after the 16th of June 2024.

The timeseries suggests that the number of new covid cases are in steady decline.
The average rate of decline forecasted is -0.000000000000000045894196857 per day.

This could be due to any of the following reasons:
1. Heard immunity
- The number of vaccination individuals could have reached a point
whereby we have achieved heard immunity, hereby reducing the spread
of the virus and decrease the number of new cases.

2. Lockdowns
- Lockdowns could decrease the number of people who are willing and able 
to get tested for covid due to decreased rates of mobility. When people are
not mobile they are less likely to visit testing stations and more likely
to treat themselves at home.

3. Covid fatigue
- A lack of data could the cause of what appears to be a decline in
new cases. This could be caused by covid fatigue, a phonomenon whereby
data capturers could be taking the pandemic as seriously as before
therefore failure to capturer data as frequently and accurately as before.

4. Testing rates
- From looking at the data can see that on some days we have 0 new cases
while on other days we have a relatively significant number of new cases.
The spike that we see forecasted on the 21st of June 2024 could be caused by
phonomenon of having introduced new testing data periodacally in the past. 

The data suggests that we have recently entered an phase of slow decline in new cases.
This could be due to a number of factors, a few of which are mentioned above.

To improve forecast accuracy, consider including the following data:
- Vaccination rates
- Public health policy changes (eg. lockdowns, etc)
- Mobility data
- Hospitalization rates
- Testing rates

Additionally, consider making use of a regression analysis to understand which
factors correlate best to the variance in new cases observed over time.
